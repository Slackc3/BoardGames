Tabletop gaming has become a billion dollar industry in North America in last 5 years bringing in 1.2 billion dollars in the US and Canada in 2015. With so many new games being developed through major gaming companies, and Kickstarter campaigns what are the factors that determine the success of one of these projects?

The purpose of this notebook is to do an exploratory analysis of data from BoardGameGeek.com (BGG) on tabletop games. BGG is an online community for tabletop game enthusiasts where they can rate games that they own or have played. Based on data from over 4000 games our goals for this analysis are:

1. Determine what factors impact users rating of a product
2. Determine what factors are associated with consumers actually buying a product
3. Look at which categories and mechanics are most common in the highest rated games
4. Create a linear regression model to predict what the user rating will be for a game based on some of the data available.

At the end of this analysis we should have a better idea of which factors to keep in mind when developing a table top game if you are looking for good user experience (high rating) or commercial success (high ownership) and what the most popular themes and mechanics are for these games. We should also have a basic model for predicting what rating a game should expect based on its properties.
